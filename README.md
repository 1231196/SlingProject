# Sling Prototype

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project created as a training exercise for a summer internship.

## Project Overview

Sling Prototype is a full-stack web application built to practice and demonstrate proficiency with the MERN stack. The project structure includes separate `backend` and `frontend` directories for server and client code, respectively.

## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB**: Database
- **Express.js**: Backend framework
- **React.js**: Frontend library
- **Node.js**: Server runtime

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App
1. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (default React port).
- The backend typically runs on `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured).
